ðŸŸ¢ 1. Object-Oriented Programming Problem
ðŸ“Œ Problem: Library Management (Classes & Inheritance)

Create a small library system:

Create a base class Book with:

title, author, price.

A method displayInfo() to print book details.

Create a derived class EBook with:

fileSize (in MB) and format.

Override displayInfo() to include ebook details.

In main(), create an array of Book references, store both Book and EBook objects, and print their details using polymorphism.

ðŸŸ  2. Exception Handling Problem #1
ðŸ“Œ Problem: Division Calculator

Write a program that:

Takes two integers as input.

Performs division and handles ArithmeticException if the denominator is zero.

Use a finally block to print "Program Completed".

Sample Input/Output:

Input: 10 0  
Output: Cannot divide by zero  
Program Completed

ðŸŸ  3. Exception Handling Problem #2
ðŸ“Œ Problem: Age Validator

Ask the user for their age.

If the age is less than 18 or greater than 100, throw a custom exception InvalidAgeException.

Catch the exception and display "Invalid age entered".

If valid, print "Age accepted: <age>".

ðŸ”µ 4. Method Overloading Problem
ðŸ“Œ Problem: Area Calculator

Create a class AreaCalculator with overloaded methods:

calculateArea(int side) â†’ returns the area of a square.

calculateArea(int length, int breadth) â†’ returns the area of a rectangle.

calculateArea(double radius) â†’ returns the area of a circle.
In main(), demonstrate all three methods.
