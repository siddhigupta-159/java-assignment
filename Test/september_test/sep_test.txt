🏗 1. Constructor Problem

Car Inventory System

Create a class Car with fields: brand, model, price.

Implement:

A default constructor (sets "Unknown" values and price = 0).

A parameterized constructor to initialize all fields.

A copy constructor to clone another Car.

Write a test class to create cars using all three constructors and print their details.

⚠ 2. Exception Handling Problem

Bank Withdrawal Simulation

Create a custom exception InsufficientFundsException.

Create a class BankAccount with fields: accountNumber, balance.

Add a withdraw(double amount) method that:

Throws InsufficientFundsException if the amount > balance.

Deducts the amount otherwise.

In main, create an account, attempt withdrawals, and handle the exception gracefully.

🧵 3. String Problem #1

Find First Non-Repeating Character

Write a program that takes a string input and returns the first character that does not repeat.

If all characters repeat, return "None".

Example:

Input: "swiss" → Output: "w"

Input: "aabbcc" → Output: "None"
🧵 4. String Problem #2

Reverse Each Word in a Sentence

Input: "Java makes coding fun"

Output: "avaJ sekam gnidoc nuf"

Keep the word order intact but reverse the characters of each word.

🧩 5. OOPs Problem

Library Management (Inheritance + Polymorphism)

Create an abstract class LibraryItem with fields: title, id.

Add an abstract method calculateLateFee(int daysLate).

Create two subclasses:

Book: Late fee = ₹2 per day.

DVD: Late fee = ₹5 per day.

In main, create a list of LibraryItem references (both Book and DVD objects), loop through them, and print late fees using polymorphism.
